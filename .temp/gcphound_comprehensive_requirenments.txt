You are tasked with a complete UI/UX overhaul and feature enhancement for GCPHound, a graph-based tool for analyzing privilege escalation paths in Google Cloud IAM environments. The goal is to transform the existing dashboard into a modern, enterprise-grade product, similar in quality and feel to top-tier cloud security platforms like Wiz, Orca, or Datadog. This project involves redesigning all visual elements, implementing new interactive panels, and ensuring full functionality through comprehensive testing and a fix-verify loop.

Phase 1: UI/UX Redesign & Core Feature Implementation

üß† Overall Goals & Philosophy:

Focus Exclusively on UI/UX: Do not modify, refactor, or add any backend logic, graph algorithms, detection mechanisms, or APIs. All existing features and data structures must be preserved.

Modern Enterprise Aesthetic: The redesigned UI must look clean, professional, and intuitive. Employ a consistent design system across all components.

Enhanced User Experience: Improve how users interact with and understand the data presented.

üß± General Layout & Aesthetic Requirements:

Responsive Design: Implement a responsive, grid-based layout that adapts to various screen sizes.

Visual Style: Emulate the visual style of leading cloud security tools (e.g., Wiz, Datadog, Orca).

UI Elements: Utilize modern UI elements such as cards, badges, rounded borders, and soft shadows.

Color Palette: Implement a cool, consistent color palette. Default to a light theme with soft blues, purples, and greys.

Typography & Spacing: Apply consistent font sizing, weights, and spacing (padding, margins) throughout the application for a cohesive look.

Technology Stack:

React: For all frontend components.

Tailwind CSS: For all styling.

shadcn/ui: For UI components (buttons, modals, drawers, cards, badges, etc.).

Lucide React Icons: For iconography (e.g., search, user, warning, arrows, navigation icons).

recharts: For any charts, graphs, or visual data representations on the dashboard.

No MUI or Chakra UI.

üß≠ Navigation System:

Left Sidebar:

Logo & Product Name: Prominently display "GCPHound" and its logo.

Navigation Items: Dashboard, Graph, Findings, Nodes, Edges, Settings.

Active State: Clearly highlight the currently selected navigation item.

Icons: Use Lucide React icons for each navigation item.

Top Navigation Bar:

Project Selector: Dropdown to select the current GCP project context.

Date/Time Filters: Controls to filter data based on time ranges.

User Avatar & Menu: Display user avatar with a dropdown menu (e.g., profile, logout).

Theme Switcher (Optional): Allow users to switch between light and dark themes.

üéØ Specific Page & Component Redesign Requirements:

Dashboard Home (/dashboard):

Layout: Clean, organized overview.

Key Metrics:

Total Nodes (display count, icon, and trend indicator).

Total Edges (display count and icon).

Attack Paths Detected.

High-Risk Identities.

Visuals: Use animated cards or graphs (via recharts or placeholder graphs if data is not immediately available) to present these metrics.

Graph Page:

Core Logic: Maintain all existing graph rendering and interaction logic.

Canvas Panel Redesign:

Graph Legend Panel: A clearly visible panel explaining the color coding or styling for different edge types and node types.

Collapsible Graph Filters Sidebar: Allow users to toggle the visibility of different edge types and node types.

Zoom Controls: Fixed buttons for zoom in, zoom out, and reset view.

Tooltips: On hover over a node or edge, display a tooltip with concise, key details.

Nodes and Edges Views (List/Table Views):

Modals/Panels: Utilize redesigned modals or panels (consistent with shadcn/ui) for displaying detailed information.

Enhanced Layout: Improve the layout for better readability and data density.

Interactivity: Add filter bars, sorting options, and grouping capabilities.

Findings View (New Page):

Purpose: Display detected attack paths.

Layout: A sortable list or table of findings.

Finding Details (for each path):

Path Description: e.g., Origin Node ‚Üí Intermediate Step(s) ‚Üí Privileged Identity Escalated To.

Attack Complexity: (e.g., 2-hop, 5-hop).

Risk Level: (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) with a badge.

"View in Graph" Button: To visualize the selected attack path on the graph page.

Settings Panel:

UI: Redesign as a modal or a dedicated page with tabbed navigation.

Tabs:

Theme (if theme switcher is implemented).

Graph Layout (options to customize graph appearance).

Node/Edge Toggles (default visibility settings).

Configuration (e.g., upload config file, export data).

‚ú® New Interactive Feature Implementation:

Edge Explanation Panel (Triggered on Edge Click):

UI: A slide-in panel from the right side of the screen with a smooth animation and a clear close button (using shadcn/ui Drawer or similar).

Content to Display:

Edge Type Badge: (e.g., CAN_IMPERSONATE_SA, CAN_ADMIN, MEMBER_OF).

Permission: The specific IAM permission that creates this edge (e.g., iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken, iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator).

Source and Target Node IDs: Clearly identify the connected nodes.

Resource Scope: The project, folder, or organization where the permission applies.

Discovery Source: How this edge was identified (e.g., IAM Binding, Audit Log, Inference).

Human-Readable Explanation: A clear sentence describing the relationship (e.g., "User 'X' can impersonate Service Account 'Y' via the 'iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator' permission on Project 'Z'.").

Visual Cues: Use icons and badges to visually distinguish permission types and sources.

Navigation Buttons: "Go to Source Node" and "Go to Target Node" buttons that highlight/focus the respective nodes in the graph.

Optional: Link to view this relationship in raw JSON/IAM format.

Node Detail Panel + Activity Feed (Triggered on Node Click):

UI: A slide-in panel from the right (can use a shared SidePanelLayout.tsx with the Edge Explanation Panel) with a smooth animation and a close button.

Content to Display:

Node Identification: Node ID and Node Type (e.g., User, Service Account, Group, Resource, Role).

Assigned Roles: A list of all IAM roles assigned to the node, showing the role and the scope/project of assignment. Allow click-to-expand for long lists.

Risk Level Badge & Tooltip: Display a risk level (e.g., "Critical") with an explanation tooltip (e.g., "This identity can escalate to Project Owner via 2 hops.").

Incoming Edges: A list or summary of nodes/identities that have permissions leading to this node.

Outgoing Edges: A list or summary of targets this node has permissions to.

Activity Feed (If audit log data is available/integrated):

Last activity timestamp.

Recent relevant events (e.g., impersonation events, resource deployments, key creations).

Action Buttons:

"Highlight all paths from this node."

"Export node info as JSON."

üß™ Functional Requirements (Across all redesigned components):

Interactivity: All buttons, toggles, filters, dropdowns, and other interactive elements must be fully functional and trigger the correct actions or UI updates.

Dynamic Updates: Filters and selections must update the views (graph, tables, lists) dynamically without requiring a full page reload.

Modals & Drawers: All modals and side panels (drawers) must open and close smoothly. They should be dismissible via a close button and, where appropriate, by clicking outside the modal/panel. They should not overlap or cause layout issues.

Graph Interactions: All existing graph interactions (zoom, pan, select, hover) must remain intact and functional alongside new features.

Visual Integrity: Ensure no visual glitches. Spacing, padding, scrolling, and overflow must be handled cleanly across all components and screen sizes.

State Management: Ensure that UI state (e.g., selected filters, open panels, current view) is managed correctly and consistently. Inter-component communication should be robust.

Phase 2: Functionality Restoration & Comprehensive Testing

üö® Your Task: Fix, Test, Verify, Repeat.
After the initial redesign and feature implementation, it's common for some interactivity to be broken. This phase focuses on restoring all functionality and ensuring the dashboard is production-ready through exhaustive testing.

‚úÖ Core Objective:
Restore 100% of the intended functionality to all dashboard components, buttons, filters, graph interactions, modals, and navigation elements without altering the new visual design achieved in Phase 1.

üîß Specific Areas to Fix & Verify:

Button & Event Handlers: Ensure all buttons (e.g., "Share Report", metric card clicks, "View in Graph", panel action buttons) trigger the correct modals, side panels, or actions.

Toggles, Filters, Sorting: All visual controls for filtering, sorting, or toggling views/data must actively update the UI.

Graph Interactions:

Clicking a node must open the Node Details panel.

Clicking an edge must open the Edge Explanation panel.

Zoom controls, path highlighting, and click-to-select functionalities must work flawlessly.

Navigation: All sidebar and top-bar navigation tabs must switch views correctly and update active states.

Layout & State Switching: Fix any broken layout issues during transitions or state changes.

Filter/Search Functionality: All dropdown filters, text input searches, and graph filter panels must update the displayed data in real-time. The graph must respond to these filter changes.

Modal & Drawer Logic: Ensure side panels and modals open/close smoothly, can be dismissed correctly (X button, click outside), and do not overlap or cause z-index issues.

State Persistence & Communication: Selected node/edge state must be correctly shared and reflected between the graph, information panels, and any relevant metrics. Reactive updates must be functional.

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Notes for Fixing:

Focus on reconnecting event handlers, state management logic (React hooks like useState, useEffect, Context API, or existing state stores), and component communication.

If components were renamed or refactored during the redesign, ensure they are correctly wired up.

Prioritize using shadcn/ui component behaviors where applicable but restore any lost custom logic.

üß™ Part 3: Write and Execute Comprehensive UI/UX Test Suite

üéØ Goal: Create an exhaustive automated UI/UX test suite. Run these tests, diagnose any failures, fix the underlying issues, and repeat until all tests pass and the dashboard is deemed fully functional and production-grade.

üõ†Ô∏è Testing Framework & Practices:

Tooling: Use Playwright (preferred) or Cypress.

Test Characteristics: Tests must be fast, reliable, and isolated.

Selectors: Use stable selectors (e.g., data-testid, aria-label) rather than brittle class names or DOM structures.

Test Location: Place all tests in a dedicated directory (e.g., /tests/e2e/).

üìã Minimum Test Coverage Requirements:

Navigation:

Verify all sidebar and top-bar tabs navigate to the correct views.

Confirm correct highlighting of the active tab.

Dashboard Metrics:

Verify all metric cards (Total Nodes, Total Edges, Attack Paths) render values (even if mock data).

Test that clicking on metric boxes opens the correct modal or filtered view.

Modals and Drawers:

Test opening and closing of "Total Nodes" and "Total Edges" modals.

Verify Node Detail panel opens on node click and closes correctly (X button, background click if applicable).

Verify Edge Explanation panel opens on edge click and closes correctly.

Graph Interactions:

Confirm clicking a node highlights it and opens its detail panel.

Confirm clicking an edge opens its explanation panel.

Test zoom in/out/reset buttons.

Verify that filtering node/edge types dynamically affects visible elements on the graph.

Test hover tooltips if implemented.

Buttons and General Interactions:

Test "Share Report" button functionality.

Verify all filters, dropdowns, and toggles update the UI as expected.

Ensure search boxes filter results correctly.

Settings Page:

Test theme toggle (if it exists).

Verify graph layout options update the canvas (if applicable).

Error Cases & Empty States:

Test behavior when clicking a potentially broken button (should show an error or be gracefully handled).

Verify safe redirection or handling for invalid tab routes.

Ensure the graph renders an appropriate "empty state" message or doesn't crash when no data is available or all data is filtered out.

üî¨ Extended Test Coverage (Strive for Maximum Functionality):

Edge & Boundary Cases:

Click a node with no incoming/outgoing edges (panel should show a "no edges" state).

Open and close 10+ modals/panels rapidly (test for UI hangs or memory leaks).

Filter graph until 0 nodes/edges remain (verify proper empty state message).

Input exceptionally long strings (e.g., 100+ characters) into search bars (check for crashes or UI breaks).

Interact with the graph while a panel is open (verify both UI elements stay in sync and don't interfere).

Regression Tests:

Ensure Node Detail and Edge Explanation panels still update correctly after a UI theme change (if applicable).

Navigate away from and back to the Dashboard page (verify all state resets or persists correctly as intended).

Change tabs multiple times rapidly (check for stale panels, race conditions, or missing state).

Stress & Performance (Simulated):

If possible, test with a larger mock dataset (e.g., 500+ nodes/edges) to gauge render performance and responsiveness.

Apply multiple complex filters simultaneously and check graph/UI response time.

Zoom in/out/drag rapidly on the graph (ensure stability and no visual tearing).

Interaction Consistency:

Pressing the ESC key while a modal or panel is open should close it.

Pressing Enter in a search bar should trigger the search or expected action.

Hovering over interactive elements (nodes, edges, buttons) should show tooltips or highlights without glitches.

Accessibility (A11y) Checks:

Ensure all buttons, controls, and interactive elements have appropriate aria-label or aria-labelledby attributes for screen readers.

Verify logical tab key navigation through all interactive elements on a page.

Confirm keyboard-only users can open/close panels, trigger actions, and navigate the dashboard.

Responsive Behavior:

Simulate tablet viewport (e.g., 768px width) and verify all controls are usable and layout is maintained.

Ensure the graph canvas resizes correctly and maintains aspect ratio/usability on window resize.

Check for proper overflow handling (scrolling) in smaller viewports.

üîÅ Auto-Fix Loop Mandate:

Run Full Test Suite: Execute all automated tests.

Diagnose Failures: For each failed test, identify the root cause of the bug (e.g., broken event handler, incorrect state update, CSS issue).

Implement Fix: Correct the code to address the identified issue.

Re-run Test: Re-run the specific failed test (and related tests) to verify the fix.

Iterate: Continue this cycle until all tests in the suite pass.

üèÅ Final Instruction & Completion Criteria:
Do not stop until:

Every screen, modal, sidebar, and UI element is fully redesigned according to the aesthetic and component requirements.

The new Edge Explanation Panel and Node Detail Panel + Activity Feed are implemented and fully functional.

All previously existing and newly implemented interactivity is fully restored and working as expected.
