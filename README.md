**EscaGCP** maps identities, roles, and resources across Google Cloud to uncover attack paths and risky permissions. It collects data (IAM, identities, resources, logs, Cloud Build, GKE, tags), builds a graph, analyzes for privilege escalation and lateral movement, and presents the results in an interactive dashboard or a standalone HTML report.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project is for educational and research purposes and was developed with the help of AI tools. It is not production-ready. Review, test, and harden thoroughly before using it in real environments, and use at your own risk.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install -e .

# Run automatic scan (lazy mode)
escagcp run --lazy

# Or run step by step
escagcp collect --projects YOUR_PROJECT_ID
escagcp build-graph --input data/ --output graph/
escagcp analyze --graph graph/escagcp_graph_*.json
escagcp visualize --graph graph/escagcp_graph_*.json
```

By default, `run --lazy` opens the React dashboard. To use the legacy HTML dashboard, add `--use-old-dashboard`. To create a shareable HTML report anytime:

```bash
escagcp export --graph graph/escagcp_graph_*.json --output escagcp_report.html
```

## How it works

1. Collect: callers in `escagcp/collectors/` gather IAM policies, service accounts, projects/folders/orgs, Cloud Build, GKE, tags, and (optionally) audit logs
2. Build: `GraphBuilder` converts the data into a directed graph
3. Analyze: `PathAnalyzer` finds escalation chains, lateral movement, and critical nodes with risk scoring
4. Visualize: view in the React dashboard or export a self‚Äëcontained HTML report

## Key capabilities

- Comprehensive IAM and identity mapping across org/folder/project scopes
- Attack path discovery (impersonation, key creation, VM/Cloud Run/Functions deploy, Cloud Build, GKE WI, tag-based conditions, and more)
- Risk scoring for nodes and edges; highlights critical nodes, roles, and confirmed activity from audit logs
- Interactive React dashboard (with filters, legend, graph controls) or legacy HTML dashboard
- Shareable, single‚Äëfile HTML reports; optional ‚Äúwhat‚Äëif‚Äù simulations via CLI
